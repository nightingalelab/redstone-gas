# Redstone Gas Management Project

This repository contains all the code and analysis related to the Redstone Gas Management Project.

Redstone is an Optimistic Rollup built on the OP Stack by Lattice. It aims to be a highly efficient and cost-effective rollup for on-chain games and other heavy applications. This project focuses on modeling the costs of running the Redstone mainnet and stress-testing the operationâ€™s sustainability.

A key part of this project was the development of Redsim, a simulation framework to model Redstone's Sequencer operation and its associated revenue and costs. You can run Redsim on this [Google Collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15ezt9HhfSS8vMUDngTN7VT7Uw9qO8jYz?usp=sharing) or by installing the [python pacakge](https://pypi.org/project/redsim/) locally.
